# malware_signature_generation
Employing GANs to generate malware signatures.

First of all I love the idea of converting malwares to signature images then employing CNNs to classify them. (See D Gilbert et al Using CNNs for classification of malware represented as images)

Imagine a police department has photos of a criminal
family and they are sure that they will have criminal
descendants. In our case those photos come from the  Malimg dataset, extracted from Microsoft's Kaggle malware dataset.

Wouldnâ€™t it be great if the police had the skecthes of future
suspects from this family? So they can monitor them even before
they commit a crime. This may not work in for people as
the probabilities are almost infinite however, in my personal opinion, it is likely to achieve considering malwares. 

Even if the idea is crazy I would like try it for fun.

Here a schema of a possible scenario for a malware
detector using this technique.

Algorithm :___________________________________
Data= Microsoft Malware Classification Challenge
Malware_Images = CNN_Classified(Data)
Generated_Images = GAN_(Malware_Images)
DNN_Classifier = Trained_Network(Malware_Images)

Test_Data: Any Network Traffic
    
    If DNN_Classifier == Likely _Malware
        Search
    Else
        Pass
